# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.23] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Doc-test for `CachePromptConfig` includes `cache_ttl` field.

## [0.6.22] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Rustfmt on `anthropic.rs` (publish gate).

## [0.6.21] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`CacheControl::ttl`** — optional `"5m"` or `"1h"` tier for Anthropic prompt caching (`CacheControl::ephemeral_ttl`).
- **`CachePromptConfig::cache_ttl`** — threads TTL through `apply_cache_control()`.
- **Anthropic provider: native `cache_control` serialization** — system prompts with cache markers are sent as structured content blocks (not flattened strings); user messages with `cache_control` use block layout. Requests using the 1h tier automatically include `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31,extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11`.

## [0.6.20] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **Mistral embedding: corrected `MISTRAL_EMBED_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` from 512 to 256 (true API limit).** Empirical binary-search testing against the live Mistral API confirmed the actual hard limit is **256 inputs per request** (n=256 → OK, n=257 → HTTP 400 / code 3210 "Too many inputs in request"). The previously assumed value of 512 caused every large-document ingestion (with >256 short entity names) to fail permanently. `max_batch_size()` now returns 256, and `embed()` / `embed_batch_http()` enforce this limit. The defence-in-depth guard in `embed_batch_http` is also tightened accordingly.

## [0.6.19] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **`ProviderFactory::create_llm_provider_with_headers()`** — new factory method that creates an LLM provider and injects caller-supplied HTTP headers into every outgoing request. Enables B2B / multi-tenant metadata (`x-request-id`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-correlation-id`, traceparent, HMAC tokens) to flow from an API gateway through to the upstream LLM API. Supports `anthropic`, `openai-compatible`, `gemini`, `vertexai`, `mistral`, and `nvidia` providers. Providers that do not yet expose `with_extra_headers()` (`openai`, `openrouter`, `xai`, `huggingface`, `azure`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `vscode-copilot`, `bedrock`, `mock`) fall back to plain creation with a `debug`-level trace log.

## [0.6.18] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **Mistral embedding: defense-in-depth `embed_batch_http` guard for HTTP 400 error code 3210.** Added a secondary batch-size enforcement check at the HTTP layer so that even when upstream code bypasses `max_batch_size()`, the Mistral provider enforces the 512-input hard limit per request before sending. This complements the `max_batch_size()` fix from v0.6.15 and prevents silent truncation or permanent failures when callers construct custom batch sizes.

## [0.6.17] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **`with_extra_headers()` builder on `AnthropicProvider`, `GeminiProvider`, and `NvidiaProvider` (completes [edgequake#132](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/edgequake/issues/132)).** All five major providers now support caller-supplied HTTP headers for B2B/multi-tenant deployments. Custom headers such as `x-request-id`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-correlation-id`, `traceparent`, and HMAC tokens are propagated to every outgoing LLM API call. Reserved headers (`authorization`, `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`, `content-type`, `content-length`, `host`, `user-agent`) are silently dropped to prevent accidental credential overrides. Coverage details:
  - `OpenAICompatibleProvider` — headers injected via `ProviderConfig.headers` → client default headers (added in v0.6.16)
  - `MistralProvider` — chat path delegates to inner `OpenAICompatibleProvider`; embed/audio/OCR path uses rebuilt reqwest client with default headers (added in v0.6.16)
  - `AnthropicProvider` — headers merged into per-request `HeaderMap` via the `headers()` helper (**new in v0.6.17**)
  - `GeminiProvider` — headers applied via rebuilt reqwest client with default headers; covers all Google AI and VertexAI request paths (**new in v0.6.17**)
  - `NvidiaProvider` — chat/embed path delegates to inner `OpenAICompatibleProvider`; model-listing client rebuilt with default headers (**new in v0.6.17**)

## [0.6.16] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **`with_extra_headers()` builder on `MistralProvider` and `OpenAICompatibleProvider` (closes [edgequake#132](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/edgequake/issues/132)).** B2B multi-tenant deployments can now propagate custom HTTP headers (`x-request-id`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-correlation-id`, `traceparent`, HMAC tokens, …) from inbound API requests into all outgoing LLM provider calls. Reserved headers (`authorization`, `content-type`, `content-length`, `host`, `user-agent`) are silently skipped to prevent overriding provider authentication. The feature covers both chat and embedding request paths.

### Fixed

- **CI `publish.yml` is now idempotent.** A new `Check if version already published` step queries the crates.io JSON API before attempting `cargo publish`. If the version already exists (HTTP 200), the publish step is skipped (shown as grey/skipped in GitHub Actions). This prevents the recurring `exit code 101 — crate already exists` failure when a developer publishes manually before the tag-triggered CI workflow runs. See `specs/edgequake-llm-update/CI_PUBLISH_IDEMPOTENCY.md`.

## [0.6.15] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **Mistral embedding provider now correctly reports `max_batch_size()` as 512.** The Mistral embeddings API enforces a hard limit of 512 inputs per request (HTTP 400, error code 3210: "Too many inputs in request"). Previously, `MistralProvider::max_batch_size()` fell through to the trait default of 2048, causing large documents (e.g. multi-hundred-chunk PDFs) to fail permanently with this error. A new constant `MISTRAL_EMBED_MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 512` is introduced and returned from `max_batch_size()`. The operator can further reduce this limit via the `EDGEQUAKE_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` env var, but the Mistral hard limit of 512 is always enforced as the ceiling.

## [0.6.14] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **First-class NVIDIA NIM provider (`nvidia`) with factory integration.** Added a dedicated `NvidiaProvider` with static model catalog, dynamic `GET /v1/models` discovery, free-tier model tagging, tool calling, streaming compatibility, and provider exports through `lib.rs`.
- **HTTP 202 async-inference handling for NVIDIA non-streaming chat paths.** `NvidiaProvider` now handles queued inference by extracting `NVCF-REQID` and polling NVIDIA's status endpoint until completion (or timeout), then parsing a normal completion response.
- **NVIDIA E2E and unit test coverage.** Added `tests/e2e_nvidia.rs` plus expanded provider unit tests for request mapping, tool-choice serialization, polling constants, and model-catalog integrity.
- **NVIDIA usage docs and example.** Added provider deep-dive docs under `docs/providers/nvidia/` and a runnable example at `examples/nvidia/chat.rs`.

### Changed

- **Provider deep-dive docs moved to `docs/providers/`.** Gemini and Mistral deep-dive folders were moved from `docs/provider/` to `docs/providers/`, and all cross-references were updated.
- **Provider guides updated for NVIDIA.** `README.md` and `docs/providers.md` now include NVIDIA in provider matrices and setup sections.

## [0.6.13] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Native Mistral audio + OCR coverage in the Rust provider.** `MistralProvider` now exposes typed wrappers for `/v1/audio/speech`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (including multipart upload and raw SSE mode), `/v1/ocr`, and `/v1/audio/voices` endpoints.
- **Expanded Gemini and Vertex regression coverage.** New E2E tests now cover Gemini tool-call ID continuity plus Vertex AI chat and embedding paths to guard release-level behavior.
- **Provider deep-dive docs for Gemini and Mistral.** Added implementation-level references and gap analyses under `docs/providers/gemini/` and `docs/providers/mistral/`, including a live Mistral model snapshot.

### Fixed

- **Gemini function-call ID continuity across turns and streams.** `functionCall.id` is now preserved end-to-end and mapped back into `functionResponse.id` and streamed tool-call deltas.
- **Gemini SSE chunk-boundary parsing stability.** Streaming now buffers partial `data:` lines and parses only complete payloads, preventing dropped/truncated chunk parsing at chunk boundaries.
- **Provider documentation model drift.** Gemini/Vertex/Mistral model sections and defaults were refreshed against current official docs and live model listings validated on 2026-04-23.

## [0.6.12] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Cache-write accounting is now exposed on the normalized response contract.** `LLMResponse` and `StreamUsage` can now carry prompt-cache write tokens separately from cache hits, which gives downstream runtimes enough information to show accurate Anthropic-compatible cost breakdowns.
- **Shared provider schema normalization utilities.** A new `schema_utils` module centralizes strict-mode budget checks, recursive key stripping, `additionalProperties: false` enforcement, nullable-type conversion, and OpenAI strict-schema normalization helpers for provider adapters.

### Fixed

- **Anthropic tool strict-mode budget handling.** Tool conversion now disables `strict` across the request when the aggregate strict-tool limits would be exceeded, instead of sending a request shape Anthropic-compatible endpoints reject.
- **Anthropic-compatible streaming no longer drops the final unterminated SSE frame.** The streaming adapters now flush the last buffered `data:` line even when the upstream server closes without a trailing newline, which preserves final tool-call JSON deltas.
- **Bedrock and Gemini tool schemas are normalized to the provider subset they actually accept.** Bedrock now reuses the Anthropic-compatible schema sanitization path, and Gemini strips unsupported JSON Schema keywords while converting nullable type arrays into Gemini-compatible `nullable: true` declarations.

## [0.6.11] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Explicit Anthropic-compatible provider parity is now complete.** The final explicit factory path now carries through `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` as well as the blank-value fallback from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, which is required for real POE-backed EdgeCrab sessions.
- **Live POE verification now covers the exact explicit-provider path used by downstream apps.** This closes the last gap between unit coverage and real CLI runtime behavior.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Explicit Anthropic provider creation now honors the same fallback contract as from-env and config-based setup.** Requests created through the factory path now correctly treat blank `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as unset and fall back to `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, eliminating the last remaining POE runtime path that could still miss the required `x-api-key` header.
- **Live Anthropic-compatible E2E coverage added.** A real network regression now proves the POE-style path succeeds with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.poe.com`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=''`, and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` set.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Anthropic credential fallback for POE and compatible gateways.** Empty or whitespace-only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values are now treated as unset, so the provider cleanly falls back to `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and sends the required `x-api-key` header for POE and other Anthropic-compatible endpoints.
- **Official Claude 4 metadata alignment.** Anthropic provider context limits and current model references were refreshed against the official Anthropic documentation verified on 2026-04-20.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Rust 1.95 toolchain baseline.** The repository is now pinned to Rust 1.95.0 for local development, CI, and release verification so Bedrock-enabled builds use one consistent toolchain.
- **AWS Bedrock release path hardened.** The Bedrock integration remains pinned to the latest published AWS SDK crates currently available, and the legacy TLS dependency path was removed from the release build so the crates.io security gate now passes cleanly.

### Fixed

- **Crates.io release readiness.** README install snippets, changelog metadata, lockfile state, and Bedrock dependency audit results are now aligned for a clean tagged publication.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **AWS Bedrock tool-call name normalization** now deterministically sanitizes malformed or overlong tool names to satisfy Bedrock's strict identifier rules, preserves multi-turn tool history, and adds both unit and live E2E regression coverage for the failure mode.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Clarified the GitHub Copilot documentation around direct auth, Auto-first routing, and the WHY behind session-based model selection so downstream consumers do not cargo-cult a brittle fixed-model setup.
- Synced the Rust and Python package metadata for `edgequake-litellm` so release automation and published artifacts now agree on the same version line.

### Fixed

- Updated the remaining VS Code Copilot endpoint assertions to match the current verified individual-account API hostname, keeping the release test suite green.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Prefer the live VS Code Copilot auth cache over stale local token copies when refreshing Copilot credentials, which improves parity with the real VS Code authentication flow.
- Default Copilot chat selection now follows official Auto mode semantics, because GitHub's own router is the source of truth for which chat-capable model and session token should be used.
- Auto-session resolution now skips responses-only models and forwards the Copilot session token when GitHub requires it, which is why EdgeCrab can now behave like the real VS Code client instead of guessing.
- Long-lived weekly/global Copilot throttles now fail fast with the upstream scope preserved, instead of being retried like short burst limits.
- EdgeCrab setup, doctor, and Copilot E2E detection now recognize VS Code’s real auth cache locations on macOS and Linux.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Copilot model alias + Auto resolution parity.** The VS Code provider now normalizes vendor-prefixed model IDs like `copilot/gpt-4.1`, resolves `copilot/auto` from the live Copilot model catalog using server-advertised metadata only, removes heuristic fallbacks, and adds verified live E2E coverage for `gpt-5-mini` and `copilot/gpt-4.1` while preserving genuine upstream weekly-rate-limit responses verbatim.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **VS Code Copilot parity refresh.** The direct Copilot provider now mirrors the modern VS Code client more closely with current request headers, interaction IDs, richer rate-limit classification, better token import discovery, and a default chat model of GPT-5 mini.

### Fixed

- **Actionable Copilot throttling diagnostics.** Weekly and long-window rate limits now preserve the upstream error code, scope, and retry window instead of collapsing into a generic retry loop.
- **Cross-platform token discovery for Copilot auth.** The token manager now checks the real GitHub Copilot auth cache locations used on macOS and Linux, improving out-of-the-box direct-mode authentication.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Default Ollama LLM model changed to `gemma4:latest`** (First Principle).
  `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL` is now `"gemma4:latest"` (was `"gemma3:12b"`). This
  aligns the Ollama provider default with the project-wide `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL`
  constant. The default embedding model remains `embeddinggemma:latest`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Ollama Cloud API key support (Issue #162).** New `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment
  variable enables Bearer token authentication for Ollama Cloud and any Ollama
  endpoint requiring auth. Builder method: `.api_key("key")`. Proxy bypass
  (`no_proxy`) now only applies to localhost connections.
- **Embedding batch size control (Issue #165).** New `embed_batched()` method on
  `EmbeddingProvider` trait automatically splits large embedding requests into
  chunks. Configurable via `EDGEQUAKE_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable
  (default: 2048). Prevents 422 errors from servers with batch limits (e.g.,
  HuggingFace TEI default of 32).
- `max_batch_size()` method on `EmbeddingProvider` trait for provider-specific
  batch size configuration.

### Fixed

- **Lenient embedding deserialization (Issue #164).** OpenAI provider now uses a
  manual HTTP client for embeddings instead of async-openai's strict types. This
  supports HuggingFace TEI, Infinity, FastEmbed, and other OpenAI-compatible
  embedding servers that omit the cosmetic `object` field in responses.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Streaming usage propagation now survives terminal chunks across providers.**
  When a provider supplies authoritative usage metadata only at the end of a
  stream, the Rust core now carries that usage on the terminal stream chunk
  instead of dropping it before downstream consumers can persist or display it.
- **LiteLLM Python fallback streaming now preserves final usage accounting.**
  The synthetic `StreamChunk::Finished` produced from the completed fallback
  response now includes prompt, completion, cache-hit, and thinking token
  counts so Python streaming consumers receive the same authoritative usage as
  non-streaming calls.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Image generation API in the Rust crate** via `ImageGenProvider`,
  `ImageGenFactory`, `ImageGenRequest`, and `ImageGenResponse`.
- **Image generation provider support** for Gemini image generation, Vertex
  Imagen, FAL, and a mock image backend for local tests.
- **xAI Grok 4.20 model coverage** for the latest Grok release line.

### Fixed

- **Bedrock model resolution and request parsing** were hardened after the
  `0.4.0` release, including stricter Converse request handling and clearer
  failures for invalid model IDs.
- **OpenAI / Azure compatibility** now preserves tool call formatting,
  `ToolChoice::Function`, temperature guards, and rate-limit classification
  based on provider error codes instead of brittle message matching.
- **OpenAI-compatible gateways** now handle embeddings, reasoning-effort
  settings, and LM Studio / Ollama compatibility more consistently.
- **OpenRouter, Anthropic, Ollama, and Mistral provider audits** closed API
  compliance gaps around tool call history, JSON mode, duplicate streaming
  terminals, thread-safe API key handling, and safe prompt behavior.

### Changed

- **AWS Bedrock internals** moved further toward a typed Converse-based path,
  with multimodal handling, thinking support, retry behavior, and AWS SDK
  updates aligned with the post-`0.4.0` history.
- **Provider and release documentation** now matches the actual published
  history and the full current provider surface, including Rust-only image
  generation providers and the tag-driven crates.io / PyPI flow.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **`ProviderType::VertexAI`** — new distinct enum variant separate from `Gemini`; strings
  `"vertex"` / `"vertexai"` now parse to `VertexAI` instead of `Gemini` (fixes #31).
- **`vertex_host()` helper** — returns `aiplatform.googleapis.com` (global endpoint) so
  Gemini-3.x models no longer fail with regional endpoint errors (fixes #26, #37).
- **`default_thinking_config()`** — Gemini-3 uses `thinking_level`, Gemini-2.5 uses
  `thinking_budget`; applied automatically in chat / stream / tool-stream paths (fixes #28).
- **`thought_signature: Option<String>`** added to `ToolCall` struct — propagated across
  all providers and serialised only when `Some` (fixes #41, #42).
- **`thought_signature: Option<String>`** added to `StreamChunk::ToolCallDelta` — enables
  cross-chunk thought-signature propagation during streaming (fixes #42).
- **xAI timeout raised to 600 s** for Grok 4 / Grok 4-latest deep-reasoning models that
  may stream for several minutes before the first token arrives (fixes xai long-reasoning).
- **Local CI script** `scripts/ci-local.sh` and guide `docs/local-ci.md` — run every CI
  check locally before pushing; supports per-job (`fmt`, `test`, `python`, …) execution.
- **`audit.toml`** — acknowledges known unmaintained transitive crates (`backoff`,
  `instant`) with no upstream fix; keeps `cargo audit` clean.
- **Release artifacts on GitHub Releases** — the crates.io publish workflow now
  attaches the packaged `.crate` file and release notes extracted from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed

- **Multi-tool streaming** — replaced `map` with `flat_map` so all `Part` values in a
  streamed response are emitted; added a monotonic per-call index counter to keep tool
  call ordering stable (fixes #33).
- **Tool result grouping** — consecutive tool results are now grouped into a single user
  `Content` with multiple `functionResponse` Parts, matching the Gemini API requirement
  (fixes #33).
- **HTTP 429 / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`** — both the blocking and streaming Gemini paths now
  map this status to `LlmError::RateLimited` instead of a generic error (fixes #35).
- **VertexAI URL construction** — `build_base_url()` and `build_cache_url()` now use
  `vertex_host()` so requests always target the correct endpoint (fixes #26).
- **`thought_signature` echo in assistant turns** — `functionCall` Parts are sent back
  with the original `thought_signature` echoed from the assistant turn (fixes #41).
- **Security dependency bumps** — `aws-lc-rs` 1.16.0 → 1.16.2 (RUSTSEC-2026-0044–0048),
  `aws-lc-sys` 0.37.1 → 0.39.1, `quinn-proto` 0.11.13 → 0.11.14 (RUSTSEC-2026-0037),
  `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9 → 0.103.10 (RUSTSEC-2026-0049).
- **aarch64 wheel build CI** — replaced slow/fragile QEMU cross-compilation with native
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` GitHub-hosted runner; `continue-on-error` safety blanket removed.

### Changed

- `VertexAI` factory arm now routes through a dedicated `VertexAI` provider variant;
  the `vertexai:` model-string prefix in the `Gemini` arm is retained for backward
  compatibility.
- Documentation was rewritten to reflect the current provider surface, environment
  variables, release tags, and dual-package CI/CD flow.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

**Bedrock provider — native embedding support**

- **`EmbeddingProvider` implementation**: Native embedding support via the
  `invoke_model` API (not Converse). Supports Amazon Titan Embed Text v2/v1
  and Cohere Embed English v3 / Multilingual v3 / v4.
- **`with_embedding_model()`**: Builder method to set a custom embedding model.
- **`with_embedding_dimension()`**: Builder to override auto-detected dimension.
- **Default embedding model**: `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` (1024 dimensions).
- **`AWS_BEDROCK_EMBEDDING_MODEL`**: New environment variable to configure the
  embedding model at startup.
- **Batch embedding**: Cohere models use native batch embedding; Titan processes
  one text per API call.
- **Factory native embedding**: `ProviderFactory::create(Bedrock)` now returns
  native `BedrockProvider` for both LLM and embedding (no OpenAI fallback).

**Bedrock provider — comprehensive model coverage (12 providers, 30+ models)**

- **New inference profile families**: Added `deepseek.*`, `mistral.pixtral*`,
  and `writer.*` to cross-region inference profile auto-resolution.
- **Context length estimates**: Added accurate context lengths for all model
  families: Google Gemma (128K), NVIDIA Nemotron (128K), MiniMax (1M), Z.AI
  GLM (128K), OpenAI OSS (128K), Mistral Pixtral (128K), Devstral (256K).
- **54 E2E tests** across all supported model providers:
  - Amazon Nova: Lite, Micro, Pro, Nova 2 Lite/Pro
  - Anthropic Claude: 3, 3.5, 3.7, Sonnet 4, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5
  - Meta Llama: 3.2 (1B, 3B), Llama 4 Scout/Maverick
  - Mistral: Large, Pixtral Large, Magistral Small, Devstral 2, Ministral 8B
  - Google Gemma: 3 27B, 3 4B
  - NVIDIA Nemotron: Nano 12B, Nano 30B
  - Qwen: Qwen3 32B, Qwen3 Coder 30B
  - MiniMax: M2, M2.1 (reasoning models with chain-of-thought)
  - DeepSeek: R1, V3.2
  - Z.AI: GLM 4.7 Flash
  - OpenAI OSS: GPT OSS 120B
  - Cohere: Command R+
  - Writer: Palmyra X4
  - Embedding tests: Titan v2, v1, Cohere v3, v4, batch, factory
  - Tool calling: auto, required, multi-turn (with tool results)

### Fixed

**Bedrock provider — inference profile auto-resolution & error reporting**

- **Default model changed** from `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`
  (requires inference profile) to `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` (works across all
  regions without geo-restrictions).
- **Inference profile auto-resolution**: bare model IDs (e.g.,
  `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`) are now automatically resolved to cross-region
  inference profile IDs based on the configured AWS region (e.g.,
  `eu.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` in `eu-west-1`, `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` in
  `us-east-1`). Fully-qualified IDs, ARNs, and `global.` prefixes are passed
  through unchanged.
- **Detailed AWS error messages**: `SdkError<E>::Display` only prints generic
  "service error". Added `format_sdk_error()` helper using
  `ProvideErrorMetadata` to extract the actual error code and message from the
  Bedrock API (e.g., `"ValidationException: The provided model identifier is
  invalid."`).
- **Factory `block_on` panic**: `Handle::block_on()` panics when called from
  within a `#[tokio::test]` async context. Changed to
  `tokio::task::block_in_place(|| handle.block_on(...))` in all factory methods.
- **Blank text ContentBlock**: assistant messages with tool calls but no text
  content no longer include an empty text block (Bedrock rejects blank text
  ContentBlocks in multi-turn tool calling flows).
- **Mistral Pixtral inference profile**: `mistral.pixtral-large-2502-v1:0` now
  correctly resolves to inference profile ID (e.g., `eu.mistral.pixtral-*`).
- **MiniMax M2 empty response**: reasoning models (MiniMax M2/M2.1) use
  `reasoningContent` blocks for chain-of-thought. Tests now use sufficient
  `max_tokens` to allow the model to complete reasoning + text output.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-03-01

### edgequake-llm (Rust crate)

#### Added

**AWS Bedrock provider — Converse API (Issue #20)**

*Provider implementation* (`src/providers/bedrock.rs`)
- `BedrockProvider` — new LLM provider backed by the AWS Bedrock Runtime
  Converse API, gated behind the `bedrock` Cargo feature flag.
- `BedrockProvider::from_env()` — reads AWS credentials from the standard
  credential chain (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, IAM roles, SSO).
- `BedrockProvider::with_model(model_id)` — sets the Bedrock model ID
  (e.g. `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`, `amazon.titan-text-express-v1`).
- `BedrockProvider::with_max_context_length(len)` — overrides the default
  context window (200 000 tokens).
- Full `LLMProvider` trait implementation: `complete()`, `complete_with_options()`,
  `chat()`, `chat_with_tools()`, `stream()`.
- Streaming via `converse_stream()` with `futures::stream::unfold` — matches
  the pattern used by other providers.
- Tool calling support with `ToolConfiguration` and `ToolChoice` mapping
  (`Auto`, `Required`, `Function`).
- Manual `json_to_document()` / `document_to_json()` converters for
  `aws_smithy_types::Document` ↔ `serde_json::Value` (Document does not
  implement serde traits).
- 34 unit tests covering message conversion, inference config, tool config,
  JSON ↔ Document roundtrip, content extraction, stop-reason mapping.

*Feature flag*
- `bedrock = ["dep:aws-sdk-bedrockruntime", "dep:aws-config", "dep:aws-smithy-types"]`
  — opt-in with zero cost when disabled.
- Dependencies: `aws-sdk-bedrockruntime` v1, `aws-config` v1
  (`behavior-version-latest`), `aws-smithy-types` v1.

*ProviderFactory integration*
- `ProviderType::Bedrock` — new variant parsed from `"bedrock"`, `"aws-bedrock"`,
  `"aws_bedrock"` (case-insensitive).
- `ProviderFactory::create(ProviderType::Bedrock)` and
  `ProviderFactory::create_with_model(ProviderType::Bedrock, Some("model-id"))`.
- Embedding provider returns mock fallback with warning (Bedrock embedding
  support is a future enhancement).

*E2E tests* (`tests/e2e_bedrock.rs`)
- 18 integration tests: basic chat, complete, complete with options, multi-turn,
  system prompt, streaming, tool calling (auto/required/multi-turn), provider
  metadata, `with_model()`, edge cases (empty messages, long prompt, max tokens
  1, temperature 0, stop sequences), factory create.
- All tests `#[ignore]`-gated on AWS credentials with Bedrock access.

#### Fixed
- **Reasoning model false positives for Qwen3-VL and Qwen3-VL-Embedding
  (Issue #19):** `is_reasoning_model()` used overly broad `contains("qwen3")`
  which matched all Qwen3 variants, including non-reasoning models like
  `qwen3-vl-embedding-2b` and `qwen3-vl-4b`. LM Studio rejected requests with
  "Model does not support reasoning configuration." Replaced with explicit
  size-specific allowlist (`qwen3-30b`, `qwen3-14b`, etc.) that excludes VL,
  embedding, and coder variants. Added regression tests for false-positive cases.

#### Documentation
- Provider count updated from 12 to 13 in README.md.
- Bedrock added to Supported Providers table in README.md.
- Provider Setup section includes AWS Bedrock configuration guide.
- Feature flag usage documented: `edgequake-llm = { version = "0.2", features = ["bedrock"] }`.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-23

### edgequake-llm (Rust crate)

#### Added

**Gemini & Vertex AI — full feature parity**

*Provider enhancements*
- `GeminiProvider::with_embedding_dimension(dim)` — builder method to request
  a specific output dimension (128–3072) when using `gemini-embedding-001`.
- `output_dimensionality` is now forwarded to the API in every embed call
  (single, batch, VertexAI `:predict`) when a custom dimension is configured.
- `GeminiProvider::get_access_token_from_gcloud()` now falls back to
  `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token` (ADC) before failing,
  enabling service-account and CI/CD authentication without interactive login.
- Updated model table covers all GA and preview releases:
  `gemini-1.0-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash/pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash/flash-lite`,
  `gemini-2.5-flash/pro/flash-lite`, `gemini-3.0-flash/pro`,
  `gemini-3.1-pro`, `gemini-embedding-001`, `text-embedding-004/005`.

*Examples — Gemini (Google AI endpoint)*
- `examples/gemini/demo.rs` (`gemini_demo`) — full API walkthrough: completion,
  chat, streaming, tool calling, JSON mode, vision, embeddings, model listing.
- `examples/gemini/chat.rs` (`gemini_chat`) — Q&A, system prompts, multi-turn,
  temperature sweep, JSON mode.
- `examples/gemini/streaming.rs` (`gemini_streaming`) — text stream, thinking
  content display, tool-call deltas, TTFT measurement.
- `examples/gemini/vision.rs` (`gemini_vision`) — base64 PNG/JPEG, multi-image
  comparison, vision+JSON classification.
- `examples/gemini/embeddings.rs` (`gemini_embeddings`) — single / batch,
  semantic search, similarity matrix, custom dimensions, clustering.
- `examples/gemini/tool_calling.rs` (`gemini_tool_calling`) — single tool,
  multi-tool selection, forced tool choice, multi-step tool use.

*Examples — Vertex AI endpoint*
- `examples/vertexai/demo.rs` (`vertexai_demo`) — full API walkthrough
  (completion, chat, streaming, tools, JSON, vision, embeddings, thinking).
- `examples/vertexai/chat.rs` (`vertexai_chat`) — conversations, personas,
  temperature sweep, JSON mode.
- `examples/vertexai/streaming.rs` (`vertexai_streaming`) — text stream,
  thinking content, tool-call deltas, TTFT measurement.
- `examples/vertexai/vision.rs` (`vertexai_vision`) — base64 PNG/JPEG,
  multi-image, vision+JSON, explicit model selection.
- `examples/vertexai/embeddings.rs` (`vertexai_embeddings`) — single/batch via
  `:predict` endpoint, semantic search, similarity matrix, custom dims.
- `examples/vertexai/tool_calling.rs` (`vertexai_tool_calling`) — single/multi
  tools, forced choice, multi-step with result feeding, complex schemas.

#### Fixed
- `ProviderFactory::create_embedding_provider("gemini", …)` test updated to
  accept both `"gemini"` (when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present) and `"mock"
  (fallback when no credentials are available).

#### Documentation
- `examples/README.md` — added Gemini and Vertex AI sections with env-var setup
  and per-example descriptions.
- `docs/providers.md` — expanded Gemini section: full model table, embedding
  models, `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var, ADC authentication note.


### edgequake-llm (Rust crate)

#### Added

**Azure OpenAI provider — complete official-crate rewrite**
- Provider now uses the `async-openai` `AzureConfig` type (via the `Config` trait)
  instead of hand-rolled HTTP, eliminating ~400 lines of bespoke request building.
- **`AzureOpenAIProvider::from_env_contentgen()`** — reads the
  `AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_*` naming scheme used by enterprise deployments
  (`AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_API_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_API_KEY`,
  `AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_API_VERSION`).
- **`AzureOpenAIProvider::from_env_auto()`** — tries `from_env_contentgen()` first
  and falls back to the standard `from_env()` (`AZURE_OPENAI_*`) transparently.
- **`AzureOpenAIProvider::with_deployment(name)`** — builder method to override the
  active chat deployment at runtime (mirrors `with_embedding_deployment()`).

**Azure full E2E test suite** (`tests/e2e_azure.rs`) — 25 tests covering:
  - Basic chat (`chat()`, `complete()`, `complete_with_options()`)
  - JSON mode, streaming, streaming tool calls
  - Vision / multimodal (base64 JPEG, URL images, detail levels)
  - Tool / function calling
  - Embeddings (single and batch; graceful skip when deployment lacks embed support)
  - Cache-hit token extraction, provider metadata assertions
  - Factory auto-detection and `ProviderType::AzureOpenAI` explicit creation
  - Env-var isolation via `ENV_MUTEX` for safe parallel test execution

**`ProviderFactory` Azure support**
- `ProviderType::AzureOpenAI` — new variant parsed from `"azure"`, `"azure-openai"`,
  `"azure_openai"`, `"azureopenai"` (case-insensitive).
- `ProviderFactory::create(ProviderType::AzureOpenAI)`,
  `create_with_model(AzureOpenAI, Some("deployment"))`,
  `create_azure_openai()`, `create_azure_openai_with_deployment()`
- `ProviderFactory::from_env()` now auto-detects Azure when
  `AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_API_KEY` (or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`) plus endpoint are set.
- `ConfigProviderType::Azure` fully wired in `ProviderFactory::from_config()`.
- 7 new Azure unit tests inside `src/factory.rs`.

**`ImageData` URL-native helpers** (`src/traits.rs`)
- `ImageData::from_url(url)` — stores a URL directly (sets `mime_type = "url"`).
- `ImageData::is_url() -> bool` — detects whether the image is a URL vs base64.
- `ImageData::to_api_url() -> String` — returns the raw URL directly when
  `is_url()`, otherwise wraps base64 data in a `data:<mime>;base64,…` URI.
- Both `openai.rs` and `azure_openai.rs` `build_user_content` now use
  `img.to_api_url()` — URL images are passed directly to the API without
  unnecessary base64 wrapping.

**OpenAI provider improvements** (`src/providers/openai.rs`)
- `OpenAIProvider::from_env()` — new constructor that reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  (and optionally `OPENAI_BASE_URL`) with dotenvy support.
- `OpenAIProvider::supports_json_mode()` now returns `true` for all models with
  prefixes `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-5`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4`.
- Content-filter guardrail: responses with `finish_reason = "content_filter"` are
  surfaced as an `LlmError::ApiError` with a descriptive message.

**Examples reorganised into provider subfolders**
- `examples/openai/` — `basic_completion.rs`, `chatbot.rs`, `demo.rs`,
  `embeddings.rs`, `streaming.rs`, `tool_calling.rs`, `vision.rs`
- `examples/azure/` — `env_check.rs`, `full_demo.rs`
- `examples/mistral/` — `chat.rs`
- `examples/local/` — `local_llm.rs`
- `examples/advanced/` — `cost_tracking.rs`, `middleware.rs`, `multi_provider.rs`,
  `reranking.rs`, `retry_handling.rs`
- `examples/README.md` — clean 130-line provider-organised reference

**OpenAI example improvements** (now part of `openai/` subfolder)
- `openai/demo.rs` — 8 sections: provider from env, simple completion, multi-turn
  chat, streaming, tool calling, JSON mode, vision (URL image via `gpt-4o-mini`),
  model families reference. `temperature` omitted for gpt-5-mini compatibility.
- `openai/tool_calling.rs` — removed `temperature: Some(0.0)` incompatible with
  gpt-5-mini; added explanatory comment.
- `openai/vision.rs` — 5 sections: URL image, base64 image, multiple images, detail
  level comparison (low vs high), vision + JSON classification. Uses `gpt-4o-mini`.
  All images sourced from Azure's own sample dataset (no rate limits, no content filter).

**Azure full demo** (`examples/azure/full_demo.rs`)
- Section 6a: URL image via `landmark.jpg` (Azure sample, no content filter).
- Section 6b: base64 image downloaded from same URL.
- Section 7: content-filter demo — 7a intentionally triggers Azure content filter
  with `faces.jpg`; 7b uses `AZURE_OPENAI_NO_FILTER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to bypass.

**Documentation**
- `docs/providers.md` Azure section rewritten: 3-constructor table, CONTENTGEN env
  vars, programmatic builder pattern, `with_deployment()` runtime switching,
  content-filter notes, reliable Azure sample image URLs.
- Azure Vision updated to `Y` in the feature comparison table.

#### Fixed
- **`test_from_env_fallback_to_mock` flaky in full suite** (`src/factory.rs`) — test
  now clears all Azure env var variants (`AZURE_OPENAI_CONTENTGEN_*`, `AZURE_OPENAI_*`)
  before asserting mock fallback. Root cause: `from_env()` checks CONTENTGEN vars
  first; a prior serial test left them populated.

### edgequake-litellm (Python package)

#### Added
- `"azure"` provider added to `list_providers()` — callers can now pass
  `model="azure/<deployment-name>"` to route to Azure OpenAI.
- Error message for unknown providers updated to include `azure`.
- New example `examples/09_azure_openai.py` — 5 sections: provider auto-detection,
  `azure/<deployment>` chat, JSON mode, streaming, `list_providers` assertion.
- `examples/README.md` updated with example 09 in table and quick-start section.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-21

### edgequake-llm (Rust crate)

#### Fixed
- **Vision images silently dropped in Ollama provider (Issue #15):** `OllamaMessage` struct
  was missing the `images` field. Added `images: Option<Vec<String>>` with
  `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` and updated `convert_messages` to extract
  raw base64 strings (without data-URI prefix) from `ChatMessage.images`, matching the
  Ollama chat API spec.
- **OpenAI `temperature` rejected by gpt-4.1-nano / o-series (Issue #15):** Provider
  unconditionally forwarded `temperature` even for models that only accept `1.0`. Added
  an `f32::EPSILON` guard at both `chat()` and `chat_with_tools_stream()` sites — the
  field is now skipped when value equals 1.0.
- **Vision images not forwarded in LM Studio provider:** `ChatMessageRequest.content`
  was typed as `String`, making multimodal content-parts impossible. Refactored to
  `serde_json::Value` with `build_content` / `build_image_part` / `map_role` helpers.
- **Vision images not forwarded in OpenRouter provider:** Same `content: String`
  anti-pattern. Refactored to `serde_json::Value` with `openrouter_build_content` /
  `openrouter_build_image_part` helpers.

#### Added
- **`tests/e2e_ollama_vision.rs`** — 3 `#[ignore]` live e2e tests (glm-ocr:latest
  verified returning "red background") + 2 inline unit tests.
- **`tests/e2e_lmstudio_vision.rs`** — 2 `#[ignore]` live e2e tests (env:
  `LMSTUDIO_VISION_MODEL`) + 2 inline unit tests.
- 8 new unit tests across Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter provider modules.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-21

### edgequake-llm (Rust crate)

#### Changed
- **`async-openai` upgraded from 0.24 → 0.33.0** — fully adapts to the new namespaced
  type layout (`async_openai::types::chat::*`, `async_openai::types::embeddings::*`)
  and explicit feature flags (`["chat-completion", "embedding"]`).

#### Fixed
- **Issue #13 — `max_completion_tokens` for o-series and gpt-4.1 model families.**
  `CreateChatCompletionRequest` now exposes `max_completion_tokens` natively in 0.33,
  eliminating the raw-HTTP JSON injection workaround (~150 lines removed).
  Models like `o1`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, and `gpt-4.1-nano` that only
  accept `max_completion_tokens` (not the deprecated `max_tokens`) now work correctly
  out of the box.
- `ChatCompletionTools` is now an enum (`Function(ChatCompletionTool) | Custom(...)`)
  — updated provider code accordingly, removing the obsolete `ChatCompletionToolType`.
- `ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption` variants updated:
  `Auto/Required` → `Mode(ToolChoiceOptions::Auto/Required)`.
- `OpenAIError::JSONDeserialize` now carries two arguments `(serde_json::Error, String)`;
  all match arms updated in `error.rs`.

#### Added
- **Cache-hit token extraction** via `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`
  populated into `LLMResponse::cache_hit_tokens`.
- **Reasoning token extraction** via `usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`
  populated into `LLMResponse::thinking_tokens`.
- **12 new unit tests** covering the 0.33 API changes: tool wrapping, tool choice
  serialisation, `max_completion_tokens` builder, cache/reasoning token extraction,
  `FinishReason` variants, and `JSONDeserialize` error conversion.
- **11 new e2e regression tests** (`tests/e2e_openai_033.rs`) covering:
  basic chat, `gpt-4.1-nano` with `max_completion_tokens`, system prompt, streaming,
  embeddings, tool-calling via streaming, vision/multimodal, cache-hit token extraction,
  and `complete_with_options`. All e2e tests are `#[ignore]`-gated on `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

#### Removed
- `OpenAIProvider::requires_completion_tokens_param()` — no longer needed.
- `OpenAIProvider::chat_with_completion_tokens()` — superseded by native 0.33 field.
- `OpenAIProvider::stream_with_completion_tokens()` — superseded by native 0.33 field.
- `http_client: reqwest::Client` field from `OpenAIProvider` — no longer needed.

| `MISTRAL_BASE_URL` | ❌ | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` |

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **OpenAI vision**: `OpenAIProvider::convert_messages()` now correctly handles the
  `ChatMessage.images` field. User messages with images are serialized as multipart
  `content` arrays (`[{type: "text", ...}, {type: "image_url", ...}]`) instead of
  silently dropping image data. Fixes [#3](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/edgequake-llm/issues/3).
- **Azure OpenAI vision**: `AzureOpenAIProvider::convert_messages()` similarly updated
  to produce multipart `content` arrays for messages with images, enabling vision
  requests against Azure-hosted models.

### Added
- Unit tests covering multimodal message conversion in both `OpenAIProvider` and
  `AzureOpenAIProvider` (detail levels, data URI encoding, array/string content selection).
